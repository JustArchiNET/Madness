# Support

We answer all support and technical matters in our **[GitHub discussions](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/Madness/discussions/categories/support)**.

GitHub issues are being used solely for Madness development, especially in regards to bugs and enhancements. We have a very strict policy regarding that, as GitHub issues is **not** a general support channel, it's dedicated exclusively to Madness development and we're not answering common Madness matters there, as we have appropriate support channel (mentioned above) for that. If you're not sure whether your matter relates to Madness development or not, especially if you're not sure if it's a bug or intended behaviour, we recommend to use a support channel instead, where we'll answer you in calm atmosphere and forward your matter to GitHub if deemed appropriate. Invalid GitHub issues will be closed immediately and won't be answered.
